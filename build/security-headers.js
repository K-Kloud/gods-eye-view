 * object with `(0, eval)("this")` at module load, and without it the Cesium
 * widget never initializes (verified in headless Chrome). It also covers
 * Cesium's WASM decoders. `blob:` is required in the built app: Cesium's
 * bundled workers bootstrap through `importScripts(blob:...)`, which a worker
 * checks against script-src (the dev server loads them by URL instead).
 * Widen any other directive only for a real violation.
